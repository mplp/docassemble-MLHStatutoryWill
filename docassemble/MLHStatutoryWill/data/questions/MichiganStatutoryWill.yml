  Welcome to the ${ MLH_interview_short_title } tool.

  This tool will help you figure out if the ${ MLH_interview_short_title } is right for you and, if so, help you prepare one. You will be asked questions about you, your family, and your property.
---
id: intro_tool_fit
question: |
  There are many types of wills you can prepare.
subquestion: |
  The ${ MLH_interview_short_title } is a simple will. Use this tool to create a ${ MLH_interview_short_title }.

  This tool is not right for you if you:

  - are under 18 years old
  - do not live in Michigan
  - want to leave any single piece of property to more than one person
  - want to name different guardians for each of your minor children
  - are a Native American whose estate may include trust lands

  Tap **Continue** to begin
continue button field: intro_tool_fit

id: intro_tool_about
question: |
  About the ${ MLH_interview_short_title }
subquestion: |
  The ${ MLH_interview_short_title } has a set inheritance structure that assumes you want to leave most of your property to your closest relatives.

  Under the terms of this will, if you are married when you die, your spouse will inherit almost everything you own.

  If you aren't married when you sign the will, or if your spouse dies before you do, your children will inherit most of your property in equal shares.

  Your property will be distributed to extended family members if no spouse, children, or descendants survive you.

  If you want more flexibility in distributing your property, you may want to talk to a lawyer to help you with your will. Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help)  to find lawyers or legal services in your area.  If you wish to continue, tap **Continue**, otherwise tap **Exit.**

id: intro_personal_representative
question: |
  Personal representatives
subquestion: |
  You will be asked to name a **personal representative** for your estate. Your personal representative is the person who will make sure your property is distributed according to your wishes.

  This should be a responsible person that you trust, and ideally someone who lives close to you.
  It could also be a bank. Make your choice before you begin. It's a good idea to ask the person if they are willing and able to serve as personal representative before you make a final choice.

  If you have children under 18, you will also be asked to name a **guardian** to care for them and a **conservator** to manage their money. Again, make your choices and get their contact information before you begin.

  Under the statutory will, all your children will inherit **equal** shares.

  If you want to exclude one or more children from your will or want your children to inherit **unequal** shares, this tool cannot help you do that.

id: leave_cash_gifts
question: |
  You can leave up to two gifts of cash in your will.
subquestion: |
  Think carefully about whether to leave cash gifts. These cash gifts will be paid "off the top" of your estate no matter how much money you have when you die. For example, you may decide today to leave $5,000 to a friend or charity, and the rest of your estate to your children. You may then end up spending all but $4,000 of your savings before you die. In that case, the friend or charity would receive the $4,000, and your children would receive nothing.

  Each gift can be left to one person or charity. If you want to leave more than two cash gifts, or any cash gift jointly to more than one person, you can't use this tool or the statutory will to do so. You may want to contact a lawyer to help you with your will. Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) to find lawyers or legal services in your area.

id: residue_general_explanation
question: |
  Everything you own that you have not already listed is called the residue of your estate.
subquestion: |
  The cash gifts you named and the property you put on the list are **not** included in the residue. Those will be taken from your estate before the residue is distributed.

  Under this will, the residue of your estate will go to your children in equal shares. If any of your children died before you, but had children who are still living (your grandchildren), those descendants get equal shares of what your deceased child would have inherited.
continue button field: residue_general_explanation
---
id: residue_heirs_explanation
question: |
  If no spouse, children, or descendants of your children survive you, the residue will be distributed to your other relatives.
subquestion: |
  These other relatives are called your "heirs."

  Your heirs are determined by law, the same way they would be if you died without a will. First, your parents or their descendants (your siblings, nieces, or nephews) would inherit. If none of those people survive you, then your grandparents or their descendants (your aunts, uncles, or cousins) would inherit. If the court can't identify any surviving relatives in these categories, the residue of your estate will go to the state of Michigan.
continue button field: residue_heirs_explanation
---
id: residue_distribution_explanation
question: |
  If there are no living descendants or spouse
subquestion: |
  If no spouse, child, or descendent of your child is living when you die, you can choose to:

  - Leave the residue of your estate entirely to your heirs (parents, siblings, nieces, uncles, etc.); or
  - Divide it evenly between your heirs and your spouse's heirs. If you have stepchildren, this is the only way they will inherit from you, using the statutory will.

  You can only choose one of these options. If you want to distribute your property differently, you may want to contact a lawyer to help you with your will. Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) to find lawyers or legal services in your area.

id: personal_representatives
question: |
  The Michigan statute will requires you to choose a **personal representative.**
subquestion: |
  Your personal representative is the person who will make sure your property is distributed according to your wishes. The personal representative also pays any final bills you have when you die, usually by using or selling property from your estate.

  Pick a responsible person you trust to be your personal representative. You may want to choose someone who lives close to you. It's a good idea to ask the person if they are willing and able to serve as personal representative before you make a final choice.

  If there is enough money or property in your estate, you may consider choosing a bank as your personal representative.

  A bank will charge your estate a fee for that service.
