  Welcome to the ${ MLH_interview_short_title } tool.

  This tool will help you figure out if the ${ MLH_interview_short_title } is right for you and, if so, help you prepare one. You will be asked questions about you, your family, and your property.

id: intro_tool_fit
question: |
  Since writing a will can be complicated, Michigan law created a simple form called the Michigan Statutory Will.
subquestion: |
  This is a fill-in-the-blank form that becomes a legally valid will when you complete it correctly and sign it in front of two witnesses.

  The statutory will has some limits on how you can distribute your property, but it's an easy and affordable option for people who want a basic will without hiring a lawyer.

  **Will this tool work for your situation? You must meet these requirements:**

    * Be 18 or older
    * Live in Michigan
    * Not own Native American trust lands

  **This form can name the person who should distribute your property after you die. You can also:**

    * Choose who will take care of your children if they are under 18
    * Make cash gifts to up to two people or charities
    * Give specific personal items like furniture or jewelry to anyone you want
    * Leave your remaining property to your spouse and children, or to your closest family members if you do not have a spouse or children

  **Consider hiring a lawyer instead if you:**

    * Have a child with special needs who might lose benefits if they inherit money
    * Are the guardian for your spouse or adult child and need to name a replacement in your will
    * Own a business or have other complicated property, like property held in a {trust}
    * Have enough money or property to make legal fees worthwhile

  Use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) to find lawyers or legal services in your area.
continue button field: intro_tool_fit
terms:
  trust: |
    A legal tool where someone holds and manages money or property for someone else. People can use trusts as part of their estate planning to control how property is distributed after they die. A trust can say that property goes to heirs at certain ages or under specific conditions.

id: has_mental_capacity
question: |
  You must have mental capacity to make a will
subquestion: |
  You must understand what you are doing when you make your will. This is called having mental "capacity" to sign the document.
  
  To have mental capacity to sign a will you must understand:

  * You are creating a document that gives away your belongings after you die
  * What you own and approximately how much it is worth
  * Who your family members are
  * What having a will means

subject: |
  What does this mean?
content: |
  The ${ MLH_interview_short_title } has a set inheritance structure that assumes you want to leave most of your property to your closest relatives. Under the terms of this will, if you are married when you die, your spouse will inherit almost everything you own. If you aren't married when you sign the will, or if your spouse dies before you do, your children will inherit most of your property in equal shares. Your property will be distributed to extended family members if no spouse, children, or descendants survive you.
---
id: force_or_threat
question: |
  Your will must be your free choice
subquestion: |
  Your will is only valid if you create it freely. No one should force or pressure you about what to put in your will.

  It's fine to talk with family and get help, but the decisions must be yours.

  If someone is threatening or pressuring you, consider talking to a lawyer. You can use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) to find a lawyer in your area.

fields:
  - Are you choosing to make this will on your own?: force_or_threat

      - Yes, this is my choice
      - No, someone is pressuring me

id: exit_duress_influence
event: exit_duress_influence
question: |
  It sounds like you may be under duress or improper influence from another person.
subquestion: |
  You may want to contact a lawyer for help. If you are a low-income older adult or otherwise vulnerable, your local legal aid office may be able to help you. You can use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help)  on Michigan Legal Help to find a lawyer or a legal services office near you.

  If you are being abused, neglected, or exploited, you can contact your local Adult Protective Services office at 855-444-3911. If you think you are the victim of a crime by the person who is person who is pressuring you, you can call the police.

question: |
  **Warning!** Your will needs to be signed in front of witnesses to be valid
subquestion: |
  This online tool helps you write your will, but the will is not finished when you're done answering the questions in this tool. To finish the process, you must:

  * Print your completed will
  * Sign it in front of witnesses
  * Have the witnesses sign it

  This tool will give step-by-step instructions about finishing your will after you are done answering questions.

id: replace_existing_will
question: |
  Using this tool to make a new will automatically revokes (cancels) your old will
subquestion: |
  To avoid any confusion, destroy your old will after you sign the new one.

  If you filed your old will with the county probate court, file the new one there in its place. If anyone has a copy of your old will, give them a copy of your updated will and ask for the older version so you can destroy it.

  You can destroy the will by tearing it, shredding it, or writing "void" across each page.

  You can create this list now or add it to your will later. It's completely optional. Unlike the rest of your will, this list only needs your signature, not witnesses. If you change your mind later, you can update this list without changing the rest of your will.

  % if spouse:
  Everything you own when you die that you haven't already given away in this will is called the "residue" of your estate. This doesn't include property that automatically transfers to someone else when you die (like joint bank accounts or homes with survivorship rights).

  The cash gifts and personal items you listed will be given out first. The rest goes to your spouse if you're married when you die. If you're not married, it goes to your children. If any of your children died before you, but had children who are still living (your grandchildren), they get equal shares of what your child would have inherited.

  If you do not have a spouse, children, or grandchildren, your property goes to other relatives. On the next page, you'll choose how.

  % else:
  Everything you own when you die that you haven't already given away in this will is called the "residue" of your estate. This doesn't include property that automatically transfers to someone else when you die (like joint bank accounts or homes with survivorship rights).

  The cash gifts and personal items you listed will be given out first. If you have children when you die, the rest goes to your children in equal parts. If any of your children die before you but have children who are still living (your grandchildren), they get equal shares of what your child would have inherited.
  If you do not have children or other descendants (grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.) when you die, your property goes to other relatives in this order:

  * Your parents, or if they're gone, your siblings, nieces, and nephews
  * If none of those survive, your grandparents, or if they're gone, your aunts, uncles, and cousins

  If no relatives can be found, your property goes to the state of Michigan.

  If you do not have a spouse, children, or other descendants (grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc) when you die, your property goes to other relatives in this order:
 
  * Your parents, or if they’re gone, your siblings, nieces, and nephews
  * If none of those survive, your grandparents, or if they’re gone, your aunts, uncles, and cousins

  If no relatives can be found, your property goes to the state of Michigan.

  You can also choose to give half of the property to your spouse’s relatives in the same order: first to their children, then to their parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, then to their grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.

  You have two choices for how to distribute your property:

  * **Option 1:** Give everything to your relatives.
  
  * **Option 2:** Split everything evenly between your relatives and your spouse’s relatives (who inherit in the same order). Note: If you have stepchildren, this is the only way they can inherit using this will except, by leaving them cash gifts or specific personal property items in the sections you’ve already filled out.

  Choose your personal representative
subquestion: |
  Your personal representative handles your affairs after you die. They must be 18 or older. You should pick someone who is organized and trustworthy. Most people choose a family member or close friend. You can also name a bank, but they charge fees.

  Before you decide:

  * Ask if they're willing to serve
  * Consider choosing someone in or near Michigan since they'll handle tasks here

  You can name a backup personal representative in case your first choice isn't available.

question: |
  Do you want to require a bond?
subquestion: |
  Bond is like insurance that protects your family if your personal representative or conservator steals or mismanages money from your estate. If you require a bond, your personal representative or conservator will use money from your estate to pay a bond company for this insurance as part of the probate court case after you die. The fee is not returned– this is the cost for protection.

  **You might want a bond if:**

  * Your estate has a lot of money or valuable property
  * You're worried about the people you chose as personal representative or conservator
  * You want extra peace of mind for your family

  **You might not want a bond if:**

  * You completely trust your personal representative and conservator
  * Your estate is small
  * You don't want to reduce what your family inherits by the bond cost
